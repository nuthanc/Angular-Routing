# Angular-Routing

### How Routing Works

* Url is changed
* Match is passed
  * If Direct is there, then the revised url is matched
* Process Guards
* Resolve and Prefetch any data required by the Route
* Activate Component(s) associated with the Route
* Display Template(s) into defined Router Outlets
